===============================
        AGRICHAIN SYSTEM
===============================

This document explains the logical flow of the AgriChain project based on
the folder structure and role-based operations.

---------------------------------------------------------
1. MAIN MODULE (Entry Point)
---------------------------------------------------------
File: AgriChainMain.java

• Starts the application.
• Displays the login screen.
• Takes userId and password.
• Calls AuthService to validate login.
• Based on the user's role, loads the appropriate dashboard:
    - FarmerDashboard
    - BuyerDashboard
    - ConsumerDashboard
    - TransporterDashboard

---------------------------------------------------------
2. MODEL LAYER (Data Models)
---------------------------------------------------------

These classes store only the information needed for each entity.
They contain NO business logic and NO ArrayLists (since JDBC will be used).

2.1 User.java
• Base class for all roles.
• Contains: userId, name, password, role.
• Parent class for Farmer, Buyer, Consumer, Transporter.

2.2 Farmer.java
• Inherits User.
• Does not store crop list (database will handle that).
• Stores only farmer information.

2.3 Buyer.java
• Inherits User.
• Does not store order list (database will handle buyer orders).
• Represents users who buy crops.

2.4 Consumer.java
• Inherits User.
• Does not store purchase history.
• Represents the end-user who buys for consumption.

2.5 Transporter.java
• Inherits User.
• Contains vehicleId.
• Does not store assigned orders (database will handle delivery assignments).

2.6 Crop.java
• Represents a crop record.
• Contains cropId, name, quantity, price, and farmerId.

2.7 Order.java
• Represents an order made by Buyer or Consumer.
• Contains orderId, userId, cropId, quantity, status.

---------------------------------------------------------
3. SERVICE LAYER (Business Logic)
---------------------------------------------------------

These classes perform the operations requested by dashboards.
They DO NOT store data; they only create/update objects.
Database operations will be added later using JDBC.

3.1 AuthService.java
• Validates login credentials.
• Returns User object after successful login.
• Chooses the user role (FARMER, BUYER, CONSUMER, TRANSPORTER).

3.2 FarmerService.java
• Allows farmers to:
    - Create crops (later will save to DB)
    - Update crop quantity
    - Delete crop (returns cropId for DB deletion)

3.3 BuyerService.java
• Allows buyers to:
    - Create new purchase orders
    - Update order status
    - Cancel orders

3.4 ConsumerService.java
• Similar to BuyerService but meant for consumers.
• Handles:
    - Creating purchases
    - Updating the order status
    - Cancelling orders

3.5 TransporterService.java
• Responsible for:
    - Accepting delivery tasks
    - Marking orders as delivered
• Database will store delivery assignments.

3.6 FileService.java  (Optional if using JDBC)
• Handles reading/writing text files if needed.
• Will be replaced with DB operations in JDBC version.

---------------------------------------------------------
4. GUI LAYER (User Interface)
---------------------------------------------------------

Each role has its own dashboard.  
Only triggers methods in the Service layer.

4.1 LoginGUI.java
• Inputs user credentials.
• Calls AuthService.
• Redirects to correct dashboard.

4.2 FarmerDashboard.java
• Add crop
• Update quantity
• View crops
• Delete crops

4.3 BuyerDashboard.java
• Browse crops
• Place orders
• View order status

4.4 ConsumerDashboard.java
• Browse crops
• Purchase crops
• Track order delivery

4.5 TransporterDashboard.java
• View assigned orders
• Mark them as delivered

---------------------------------------------------------
5. DATA STORAGE (Text Files or Database)
---------------------------------------------------------

data/users.txt
    - Stores userId,password,role

data/crops.txt
    - Stores crops: id, name, price, quantity, farmerId

data/orders.txt
    - Stores order records

data/deliveries.txt
    - Stores transporter delivery updates

(Note: When you move to JDBC, this folder will be replaced by database tables.)

---------------------------------------------------------
6. FLOW SUMMARY
---------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: User starts the application
Step 2: Login through AuthService
Step 3: Dashboard opens based on role
Step 4: User performs actions (create crop, order crop, deliver crop)
Step 5: Service classes process the logic
Step 6: Data stored in text files or database
Step 7: User logs out or exits
